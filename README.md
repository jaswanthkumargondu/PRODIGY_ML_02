**KMeans Clustering for Mall Customers**
This project applies KMeans clustering on the "mall_customers.csv" dataset to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score.

**Overview**
The goal of this project is to explore customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically KMeans clustering. The dataset provides information on customers' annual income and spending scores, allowing us to identify distinct customer segments for targeted marketing.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project, "mall_customers.csv," contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer.
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned based on customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
Approach
This project follows these main steps:

**Data Preprocessing:**
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
Encode categorical variables, such as gender, if necessary.

**KMeans Clustering:**
Apply the KMeans algorithm to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.

**Visualization:**
Visualize the clusters to interpret and understand the customer segments.

Usage

**To run the code:**

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
Open and run the KMeans_Clustering.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

**Results**
The output of this project includes visualizations of the customer clusters formed based on their annual income and spending score. These clusters provide insights into distinct customer segments, which can inform targeted marketing strategies.
